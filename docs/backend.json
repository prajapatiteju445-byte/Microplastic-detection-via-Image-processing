    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to handle image analysis requests and results efficiently and securely, even with a large number of concurrent users. The core principle is to leverage path-based ownership for private user data and avoid `get()` calls in security rules by denormalizing data where necessary, ensuring authorization independence and enabling scalable list operations. The structure is segregated to maintain a homogenous security posture and to enable clarity of intent. We leverage explicit state modeling for analysis status and enforce naming conventions to maintain consistency.\n\n1.  **User Data:** Each user has a dedicated collection for their water samples and analysis results under `/users/{userId}`. This ensures clear ownership and simplifies security rules.  WaterSample documents are stored in `/users/{userId}/waterSamples/{waterSampleId}`. AnalysisResult documents are stored in `/users/{userId}/waterSamples/{waterSampleId}/analysisResults/{analysisResultId}`.\n\n2.  **Authorization Independence:** The `AnalysisResult` documents do not need to look up to the `WaterSample` to determine authorization. Since analysis results are nested under the water sample and the water sample is under the user, ownership is implicitly determined by the path.\n\n3.  **Scalability and Performance:** Nesting AnalysisResult under WaterSample optimizes queries for a particular user's samples and their corresponding results. To scale the image analysis workers, the file locations can be read from the waterSample object and enqueue an analysis request onto a task queue (e.g. Google Cloud Tasks) which can process samples concurrently. In addition, using ONNX or TensorRT to optimize the underlying YOLO model will allow for faster analysis times.\n\n4.  **QAPs Support:** The structure supports secure list operations because all data related to a user is namespaced under the `/users/{userId}` collection. Rules can securely filter results for a user based on their `userId` without needing to filter based on document content.\n"

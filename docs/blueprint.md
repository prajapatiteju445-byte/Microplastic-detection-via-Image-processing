# **App Name**: AquaLens

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allow users to upload water sample images for analysis.
- Microplastic Detection: Analyze uploaded images using a pre-trained YOLO model to detect and identify microplastics.  Reasoning about when to include visual cues based on confidence intervals acts as a tool for improved result visualization.
- Results Visualization: Display the analysis results, including highlighted microplastic particles, particle counts, and concentration estimates, overlaid on the original image.
- Data Export: Enable users to export analysis data in CSV format for further research or reporting.
- Help and Instructions: Include some instructions and explanation regarding microplastic detection, clarity on how the image processing is being handled and an explanation of the export options.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke water and scientific trust.
- Background color: Light blue (#E8EAF6), a desaturated shade of the primary, for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), an analogous color to the primary that provides contrast and visual interest.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its modern, neutral design.  Good for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons from Material-UI or a similar library, in the accent color to maintain a consistent look and feel.
- A clean and intuitive layout with a prominent upload button and clear sections for results and data export options.
- Subtle animations, like a loading spinner during image analysis or a gentle fade-in for results, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.

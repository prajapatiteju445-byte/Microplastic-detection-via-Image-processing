/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for AquaLens
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has complete control over their own data, including water samples and analysis results.
 * @data_structure All data is nested under the /users/{userId} path, providing clear ownership and simplifying security rules. Water samples are stored in /users/{userId}/waterSamples/{waterSampleId}, and analysis results are stored in /users/{userId}/waterSamples/{waterSampleId}/analysisResults/{analysisResultId}.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disabled to protect user privacy. Read and write access is strictly limited to the owner of the data, ensuring that only the user who uploaded a water sample can view or modify its associated analysis results.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization Not applicable, as the path-based ownership model obviates the need for data denormalization.
 * @structural_segregation Not applicable, as all data is private and user-specific.
